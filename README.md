[Jean Clipperton](https://macss.uchicago.edu/directory/jean-clipperton) is an Associate Director of MACSS and Associate Senior Instructional Professor at the University of Chicago. She is a political scientist and computational social scientist and study how individuals create and interpret meaning through language, emotion, and culture, particularly in political contexts. Her research bridges political communication, political behavior, sociology, psychology, and institutional analysis. At the center of her research is a core question: how do individuals and institutions use language to create shared understanding and construct identity?

## It's a new soundtrack: Candidates, Campaigns, and Rally playlists
As political candidates are increasingly using music at rallies and releasing or revealing playlists, placing their selected songs into this framework can provide clear and concise opportunities to study how they construct their public image, build political brands, and signal values to voters. I find both cross-party and within-candidate patterns: all candidates increased the use of pro-social language in their playlists, while Democratic candidates increasingly had more negative emotions and more moral language in their songs. Additionally, trust was the most common emotion present in all front-runner candidate playlists. Playlists can send signals about the candidates and how they view their responsibility: as a delegate acting on behalf of the people or as a brand in which voters invest. The dataset covers three presidential elections from 2016 to 2024, and over 2,000 songs. Trump, in each of his three campaigns, evidenced more 'brandidate'-type language in his playlists, with 'I' pronounced being used very heavily. In contrast, Democratic candidates tended toward delegate-type language and more inclusive 'we' language.
